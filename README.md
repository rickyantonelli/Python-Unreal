## Python Widget in Unreal
This repository explores and includes Python usage in Unreal Engine through the use of PySide/Qt widgets. The widget in this repository is for blocking out levels extremely quickly in a 3D space from a 2D grid. It includes:
- The ability to add cubes and spheres into a `QGraphicsView` - updates to the assets in the grid will reflect into your Unreal Engine level
- The widget is parented into Unreal, and both the widget and Unreal Engine can run simultaneously without the need for parenting
- Using Python 3, and tested for Unreal Engine 5 (although it likely works for Unreal Engine 4)
